# SC1
In this repo code and documentation for IOTA+ initial smart contract, we will be using Public testnet already available to validate our smart contracts, but a local and private instalation could be used. 

The base functionality of this smart contract is to convert IOTA to IEXP tokens, but first the Tokens must be created, in order to be smart contract tokens.

## Contract development
* Please see [Testnet](testnet/README.md) section for more information on how to use develop SC on IOTA testnet.
